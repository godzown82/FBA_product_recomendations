  >* **Data Cleaning:** 
  >* **Data exploration:**
  >   * The dataPreprocessing.ipynb file reads the amazon.csv file. Make sure you are using the correct path in the **setup** steps above
  >  * **Models used:** Models can be viewed in our respective branches (adedapo,randon,shubhda,alfredo)
  >    * model 1 : by Alfredo
  >    * model 2 : by Randon
  >    * model 3 : by Shubhda
